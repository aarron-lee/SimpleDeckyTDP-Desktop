# SimpleDeckyTDP Desktop

An desktop GUI/Frontend to the SimpleDeckyTDP Decky Plugin

# Requirements

Unofficial Decky Loader and SimpleDeckyTDP installed

[Unofficial Decky Loader](https://github.com/aarron-lee/decky-loader) is a fork of Decky with the required functionality for the desktop app, note that this can safely be used alongside regular Decky Loader without issue. They don't interfere with each other.

# Limitations

Note, the Desktop app does not have full feature parity with the Decky Plugin. **Certain features cannot be implemented**, such as:

- per-game profiles

# Installation

If not already installed, install unofficial decky

```bash
curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aarron-lee/decky-loader/main/dist/install_release.sh | sh
```

Then install SimpleDeckyTDP to unofficial Decky

```bash
curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aarron-lee/SimpleDeckyTDP-Desktop/main/install.sh | sh
```

Finally, download the latest AppImage from [releases](https://github.com/aarron-lee/SimpleDeckyTDP-Desktop/releases) and install it via an AppImage manager like [GearLever](https://flathub.org/apps/it.mijorus.gearlever), AppImageLauncher, etc
