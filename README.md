# SimpleDeckyTDP Desktop

An experimental desktop GUI/Frontend to the SimpleDeckyTDP Decky Plugin

Note, this requires Decky Loader + SimpleDeckyTDP to already be installed.

# Requirements

Decky Loader and SimpleDeckyTDP already installed

# Limitations

The Desktop app cannot do per-game profiles.

It also should not be used simultaneously with the SimpleDeckyTDP decky plugin, you should only use one or the other at any given time.

# Installation

If not already installed, install Decky Loader + SimpleDeckyTDP

Then, download the latest AppImage from releases and install it via an AppImage manager like GearLever, AppImageLauncher, etc
